# Beyond Basic Elements Analysis
## Xt-EHR Imaging Report Elements Classification

Based on real-world usage analysis of 2,738 imaging reports from the PARROT dataset, this document identifies specific Xt-EHR elements that are candidates for "beyond basic" classification.

## Methodology

Elements were classified based on:
1. **Presence in real-world reports** (PARROT dataset analysis)
2. **Clinical necessity** for core imaging report functions
3. **Implementation complexity** and administrative overhead
4. **Use case frequency** in typical clinical workflows

## Classification Framework
