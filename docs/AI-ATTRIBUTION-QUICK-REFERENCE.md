## 🤖 AI Analysis Attribution Statement

### Standard Attribution Text

For use in publications, presentations, and documentation:

> **AI-Assisted Analysis**: This work was compiled with the assistance of Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic), a General-Purpose AI model, in accordance with EU AI Act Article 52 transparency requirements. The AI system performed data analysis, pattern recognition, and report compilation for 2,738 real-world imaging reports from the PARROT v1.0 dataset. All findings have been validated against source data and are subject to expert review by healthcare informatics specialists.

### Short Form Attribution

For space-constrained contexts:

> **AI Attribution**: Analysis compiled with Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic). Validated by domain experts. EU AI Act compliant.

## 📋 What Was AI-Assisted?

### ✅ AI Involvement

The AI system (Claude Sonnet 4.5) was used for:

1. **Data Analysis**
   - Statistical analysis of 2,738 PARROT v1.0 imaging reports
   - Frequency calculations and usage pattern identification
   - Cross-tabulation of modalities, anatomical areas, and languages

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identification of common data elements across reports
   - Recognition of clinical vs. administrative content patterns
   - Detection of element usage correlations

3. **Comparative Mapping**
   - Mapping between PARROT dataset elements and Xt-EHR model specifications
   - Gap analysis between real-world usage and model completeness
   - Traceability linking between source data and model definitions

4. **Classification Development**
   - Categorization of elements into Basic, Intermediate, and Beyond Basic
   - Evidence-based justification for each classification
   - Implementation complexity assessment

5. **Documentation Generation**
   - Report writing and synthesis
   - Markdown documentation creation
   - Visualization recommendations
   - Executive summaries and technical documentation

### ❌ Not AI-Generated

The following were NOT performed by AI:

- Strategic project decisions and scope definition
- Domain expertise and clinical validation
- Final recommendations and policy decisions
- Stakeholder engagement and consensus building
- Legal or regulatory interpretations

| **Human Oversight** | ✅ Compliant | Expert review by Xt-EHR T7.2 Sub-team |
| **Data Protection (GDPR)** | ✅ Compliant | Using anonymized, publicly available datasets |

### Key Timeline Dates

- **2 August 2024**: EU AI Act entered into force ✅
- **2 February 2025**: Prohibited practices effective ✅
- **2 August 2025**: GPAI obligations active ✅
- **2 August 2026**: High-risk AI systems rules ℹ️ (Not applicable - Limited Risk project)

## 💡 FAQ

### Q: Why do we need AI attribution?

**A**: The EU AI Act (Article 52) requires transparency when AI systems are used, especially in professional contexts like healthcare. Users have the right to know when they're interacting with AI-generated content.

### Q: Is this project considered "high-risk" AI?

**A**: No. While healthcare AI systems CAN be high-risk, this project is research and analysis focused, not clinical decision-making. It's classified as "Limited Risk" requiring transparency but not the full high-risk obligations.

### Q: Do we need to register with any AI authority?

**A**: Not at this stage. The project uses a third-party GPAI model (Claude) whose provider (Anthropic) handles GPAI compliance. Our transparency obligations are met through attribution.

### Q: What if the AI made a mistake in the analysis?

**A**: This is why we have **human oversight**. All AI-generated findings are validated against source data and reviewed by domain experts before being finalized. The AI is a tool, not the decision-maker.

### Q: How long do we need to maintain this compliance?

**A**: As long as the AI-assisted analysis is part of the project. If the work is updated or extended, compliance measures should continue. The AI Act is now permanent EU law.
