## Evidence-Based Recommendations

### For Health Information System Vendors:
1. **Prioritize Basic Profile** for initial Xt-EHR implementations
2. **Implement intermediate elements** based on customer workflow needs
3. **Reserve beyond basic elements** for enterprise customers with specific requirements

### For Healthcare Institutions:
1. **Start with Basic Profile** to achieve immediate interoperability benefits
2. **Evaluate intermediate elements** against specific clinical workflow needs
3. **Consider beyond basic elements** only for comprehensive quality/compliance programs

### For Standards Organizations:
1. **Clearly differentiate** basic vs beyond basic element requirements in implementation guides
2. **Provide conformance levels** that align with real-world usage patterns
3. **Enable progressive implementation** without compromising core interoperability

### For Policy Makers:
1. **Focus regulatory requirements** on basic elements for widespread adoption
2. **Allow flexibility** for beyond basic elements based on institutional capacity
3. **Support staged implementation** to reduce barriers to Xt-EHR adoption

## Conclusion

This analysis provides evidence-based guidance for prioritizing Xt-EHR Imaging Report element implementation. The findings demonstrate that **a focused approach on 11 core elements delivers 90%+ of real-world clinical value** while significantly reducing implementation complexity.

The **31+ beyond basic elements** serve important but specialized functions and should be implemented strategically based on specific institutional needs rather than as universal requirements.

This pragmatic approach can accelerate Xt-EHR adoption while maintaining the option for comprehensive functionality when justified by specific use cases and institutional capacity.

## Acknowledgments

This analysis was made possible through the collaboration and contributions of two key projects:

### PARROT Project
The **PARROT v1.0 dataset** (https://github.com/PARROT-reports/PARROT_v1.0) provides the foundational real-world data for this analysis. This comprehensive collection of 2,738 multi-language imaging reports across 14 languages and 21 countries enables evidence-based assessment of actual clinical usage patterns. Without this rich dataset, empirical validation of the Xt-EHR model elements would not have been possible.

### Xt-EHR Project  
The **Xt-EHR FHIR Implementation Guide** (https://build.fhir.org/ig/Xt-EHR/xt-ehr-common/index.html) provides the comprehensive imaging report data model that serves as the basis for this classification analysis. The detailed specification of imaging report and study elements enables systematic comparison with real-world usage patterns and supports evidence-based implementation guidance.

We acknowledge the significant contributions of both projects in advancing standardized health data exchange and enabling this comparative analysis.
